Connect Four is a game setup with a board containing 7 columns and 6 rows. The objects used in this two-player game are 42 circular pieces. The pieces are differentiated by two solid colors and are divided evenly between the players. The players take turns dropping a single piece from the top of the board to its lowest available space. The first player to connect four of their pieces together wins the game. Players can win by connecting their pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
